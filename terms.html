    <h1><marquee><i> #TERMS AND CONDITIONS :</i></marquee></h1>
    <p><b>Age:</b> In most countries, individuals must be at least 17 or 18 years old to donate blood. Some regions may have a lower age limit for donors with parental consent.</p><br><br><br>
    <p><b>General Health:</b> Prospective blood donors should be in good health, free from infections, and not experiencing any acute illnesses. They should have a healthy weight and meet the physical requirements set by blood banks or donation centers.</p><br><br><br>
    <p><b>Weight:</b> Donors are usually required to meet a minimum weight requirement, which is typically around 50 kilograms (110 pounds). This criterion helps ensure that donors have enough blood volume to spare without compromising their own health.</p><br><br><br>
    <p><b>Hemoglobin Levels:</b> Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen. Blood banks typically check hemoglobin levels before accepting donations to ensure the donor has enough healthy red blood cells. The minimum hemoglobin level requirement may vary but generally falls within the range of 12.5 to 13.5 grams per deciliter (g/dL).</p><br><br><br>
    <p><b>Medical History:</b> Donors must provide accurate information about their medical history. Certain conditions or diseases may prevent individuals from donating blood. Common examples include cancer, heart disease, hepatitis, HIV/AIDS, and certain autoimmune disorders. Specific medications or recent surgeries may also affect eligibility temporarily. The donor should also have normal blood pressure during donation.</p><br><br><br>
    <p><b>Recent Tattoos or Piercings:</b> Some donation centers have deferral periods for individuals who have had tattoos or piercings within the past few months. This precaution is in place to minimize the risk of transmitting infections.</p><br><br><br>
    <p><b>Pregnancy and Breastfeeding:</b> Pregnant or breastfeeding women are generally advised against donating blood. The body requires additional blood volume during pregnancy, and nursing mothers need to maintain an adequate supply for their child.</p><br><br><br>
    <p><b>Recent Illness or Surgery:</b> If an individual has been sick or undergone surgery recently, they may be temporarily ineligible to donate blood. This is to ensure that the donor has fully recovered and is in good health before donating.</p><br><br><br>
    <p><b>Regular Intervals:</b> Blood donors must adhere to the recommended interval between donations. This interval allows the body sufficient time to replenish the donated blood components fully.</p><br><br><br>
